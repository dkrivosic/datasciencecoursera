My first markdown file

This is my first markdown file.

Here we're going load some data.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)

Let's make a pairs plot of data.

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here is a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation and temperature.

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)
```

Here's an unordered list:
